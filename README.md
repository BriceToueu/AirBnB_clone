Project Title: AirBnB Clone

Project Description:

This project aims to deploy a streamlined version of the AirBnB website on our server, implementing key features that demonstrate essential concepts in higher-level programming. Rather than creating a complete replica, we'll focus on selected features to cover core components of application development.

Project Components:

Command Interpreter: A command-line interface to manage data operations without a graphical interface, similar to a shell environment.

Website: A front-end that combines both static and dynamic elements, providing a functional user experience for viewing listings and interacting with data.

Data Storage: A database or file-based system for storing and managing application data.

API: An interface to facilitate communication between the front-end and the back-end, enabling data retrieval and updates in real time.

Command Interpreter Description

The Command Interpreter in this project is a Python-based terminal interface designed for efficient data manipulation, tailored to run within an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment. It enables users to manage, retrieve, and modify data without the need for a graphical interface.

Key Features:

Data Operations: Provides commands for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records, allowing seamless data management through a CLI.
Integrated with Data Storage: Built to interface directly with the project's database or file storage, ensuring accurate manipulation and retrieval of data.
Git-Integrated Workflow: Version control is managed with Git (version 2.25.1), enabling collaborative development and reliable tracking of changes. The interpreter can be updated and maintained through GitHub.
Development Tools and Standards:

Programming Language: Developed in Python 3.8.3, with strict adherence to PEP8 and pycodestyle (version 2.8.0) for clean, consistent code.
Editors: Compatible with VIM (8.1.2269), VSCode (1.6.1), and Atom (1.58.0), providing flexibility in development and customization.
